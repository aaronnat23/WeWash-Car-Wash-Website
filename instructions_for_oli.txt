Great! Now you need to configure Next.js for GitHub Pages. Here are the next steps:
Step 1: Update next.config.js

Go to your repository and find the next.config.js file (or next.config.mjs)
Click on it to open
Click the pencil icon (Edit this file)
Replace the contents with:

javascript/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  basePath: '/WeWash-Car-Wash-Website',
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig

Commit changes

Step 2: Wait for GitHub Actions to Build

Go to the "Actions" tab (top of your repo)
You'll see the workflow running
Wait for it to complete (takes 1-3 minutes)
Look for a green checkmark ✅

Step 3: Visit Your Live Site
Once the Actions workflow is complete:

Go back to Settings → Pages
You'll see: "Your site is live at https://aaronnat23.github.io/WeWash-Car-Wash-Website/"
Click "Visit site" to see your website!

If the Build Fails:

Check the Actions tab for error messages
Make sure your package.json has all dependencies
Verify your Next.js app builds locally with npm run build
